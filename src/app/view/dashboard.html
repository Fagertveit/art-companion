    The art companion is a set of tools that will make life a bit easier on the artist.
    At first we only have a reference library function that will make it easy to build your own artistic library of visual inspiration.
    At later stages there'll also be tools for sketching and project planing.
    Why not start at once and add images to your visual library?!
